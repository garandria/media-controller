# media-controller

Firefox plugin that gives a list of all active media tabs (youtube)
with a link to them (and normally should make you able to pause/play
the media).

I am not a JS developer, never had experience with it before so the
code may be awfull.

The code was originally an example of web extension from [this
repo](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/tabs-tabs-tabs).
